## About

This to-do application used the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React and Node.js). The Bootstrap framework was used for the UI / UX. Why? Simply, because I hadn't used it before and utlimately allowed for the focus of this project to be on the backend functionality. This application was deployed using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
